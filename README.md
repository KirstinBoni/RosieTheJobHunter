# RosieTheJobHunter
Web application to mitigate the issue of women in tech only applying to jobs they are over 100% qualified for. A tool for women to search for jobs in tech to apply for based on qualifications.

We believe that text requirements shouldn't be the barrier for women to apply to tech jobs, and we aim to mitigate that problem by providing a way for women to get the jobs they can apply to even if they don't meet all the paper "requirements."
